Publish a restaurant menu, business directory with map, product inventory or more to your WordPress site using the WebKite platform. 

== Description ==

Publish a restaurant menu, wine list, beer menu, business directory with map, product inventory, contact list or more using WebKite for WordPress. Backed by the WebKite API, WebKite makes it easy to publish a List of items and keep that List of items up to date by making changes in a Google Spreadsheet.

This plugin works with the WebKite platform so you can easily manage your Lists on your WordPress page using shortcodes.

= Publish Anywhere, Update Everywhere = 

The WebKite for WordPress plugin uses Google Spreadsheets to give you a familiar experience for data entry. Once you register with a Google account, you’ll have access to WebKite’s library of List types. Select the List type you’d like to build, and we’ll create and privately share a spreadsheet with you to fill with your data. Each spreadsheet row becomes a separate item and each column includes a unique detail for that item. Add or update items in your spreadsheet and you'll publish content in minutes instead of hours.

Using a spreadsheet to manage your information provides a number of benefits:

* **Reliable** - You can easily manage your data without worrying about server issues, vanishing storage, scaling, or unnecessary bandwidth costs. Keep track of edits and restore earlier versions when needed with Google Spreadsheet’s Revision History. Focus on creating great content instead of maintenance.

* **Easy** - Keep your List up to date is as easy as making changes in the Google Spreadsheet. When changes are synced they will update your WebKite List wherever it’s embedded. Want to add a new item, just add a new row. Need to make an update to a single item? Edit the item in the spreadsheet, hit the sync button, and the changes will be reflected wherever your List is live.

* **Sharable** - With Google Spreadsheets you can have multiple editors of your data without having to grant admin access to your WordPress site. Share the URL of your spreadsheet or invite specific users to edit, contribute, and manage your data. 

* **Convenient** - Access and update your spreadsheet from any device that supports Google Spreadsheets. This means you can manage your data using your desktop computer, laptop, tablet, and smartphone. Publish all your changes at once by clicking the sync button.

* **Flexible** - Want to use an existing .csv? Just copy and paste your data into the appropriate columns in our spreadsheet template. 

* **Powerful** - If you’re a developer, you can take advantage of Google Spreadsheets API. Use a script to add data from another source or to edit data in bulk.
